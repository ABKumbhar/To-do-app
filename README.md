# To-do-app
I have build this app as personal project in Django, REST-API, Javascript, Bootstrap and HTML. 

Three basic CRUD (create,update,delete) functionalities are added through REST API framework

- Add task to create new task
- Edit to update
- Delete to delete task
- Click on each task to make it completed (it will strike off)
